This repository demonstrates a common source of confusion in Kotlin when working with mutable lists and the functions `removeIf`, `removeAll`, and `retainAll`.  These functions offer similar functionality but have subtle differences that can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood correctly.  The example code showcases each function and highlights their usage in removing even numbers from a list.
