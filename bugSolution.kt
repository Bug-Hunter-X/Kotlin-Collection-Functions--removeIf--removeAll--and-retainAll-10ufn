The provided code is correct and demonstrates the correct usage of `removeIf`, `removeAll`, and `retainAll`. However, it is important to understand the differences:

* **`removeIf`**: Removes elements from the list that satisfy the given predicate.
* **`removeAll`**: Removes all elements that are equal to the elements of the specified collection, using the equals() method for comparison.
* **`retainAll`**: Retains only the elements that satisfy the given predicate.  All others are removed.

The example shows that all three functions can be used to remove even numbers in this specific case.  Care should be taken when choosing which function to use depending on the specific needs of your program.  For simple removal based on a predicate, `removeIf` is sufficient and often more readable.
